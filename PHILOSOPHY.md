Our philosophy is based on the distribution of free content, without any restrictions on use, in addition to the discussion and dissemination of any type of human knowledge, regardless of moral or ethical conceptions, through moral and ethical means.

We believe that knowledge does no harm, but how it will be used and how it will be reproduced. For this reason, all knowledge at Academia Abstracta is separated by means of age restrictions, which should be guided.

Our objective or discourse values impartiality, even if it is impossible to exist. We do not use any means of intervention in the constructed object, focusing entirely on distancing ourselves from the reported knowledge.

The narration of our writing is based on the observation of facts or evidence, paying attention to the minimum of intervention of convictions or arguments.

It may seem impossible, but our only belief is the objective view of the facts, only for the purpose of organizing knowledge, transforming the subjective object into an objective one through various criteria. For each work by Academia Abstrata, there will always be a set of criteria to preserve the reported knowledge.

The criteria can vary, and the way it is organized also changes depending on the criteria.
